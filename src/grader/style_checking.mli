(* This module contains several style checkers that work over
   Typed_asts. These checkers focus on mistakes involving
   inappropriate use of OCaml constructs that students learning OCaml
   (or statically-typed functional programming in general) for the
   first time often make, and many of them suggest
   semantically-equivalent expressions to replace them with.

   All checkers are scope-safe, e.g. checkers that rewrite code using
   functions from the List module will not rewrite code in scopes
   where the List module is shadowed. Names of variables introduced
   when rewriting are different from all variable names, free or
   bound, that occur in the original expression. Rewritings that
   introduce a call to a particular function will not trigger in
   scopes where that function is not in scope.

   They will also continue to work when a module has been opened in
   scope, e.g. List.tl is treated the same as tl in a scope where the
   List module has been opened, but do not recognize module aliases.

   This module must be instantiated at runtime, and then can be used
   as in the following example (made to be self-contained, but one
   would probably want to construct the Typed_ast beforehand and
   store it in a variable):

   module Style_check = Style_checking.Make ()
   Style_check.ast_style_check_structure
     (Style_check.all_checkers ())
     (Typed_ast_lib.tast_of_parsetree_structure code_ast)
*)

module type S = sig
  type checker_result = Location.t * Learnocaml_report.item
  type checker = checker_result Typed_ast_lib.checker

  (* Utilities for creating custom style checkers *)
  module Checkers : sig
    (* Report severities - this affects the status used for
       the style errors in the grading report.
    *)
    type report_severity = Suggestion | Warning

    (* For creating simple style checkers that can work on an expression
       independent of its context.
       The functions ~on_expression, ~on_pattern, and ~on_structure_item
       are called on each expression, pattern, and structure item respectively
       in the student's code AST. The results of all these are put together
       to form a style report. These functions do not need to handle
       recursion into sub-ASTs.

       An example of a style check where using the stateless style checker
       would *not* be appropriate is the checker which flags conditionals
       with too many branches; since these are formed by nested
       if-expressions. For example, if this checker was configured to flag
       conditionals more than 4 branches, upon encountering
       a conditional with 6 branches, it would raise two flags: one for
       the outer if-expression with 5 nested ifs, and one for the inner
       if-expression with 4 nested ifs.

       Another example of a check where this would not be appropriate is
       the check for unnecessary usage of append, which flags usages of
       append starting with a singleton list *unless* this happens within
       a chain of append-expressions. Since this check needs information
       about context, it cannot be implemented using stateless_style_checker.

       A simple stateless style checker can be created using this function
       and one of the report generators detailed below. Here is an example:

       let my_checker =
         let on_expression expr =
           match expr.sexp_desc with
           | Sexp_constant (Pconst_integer ("42", None)) ->
               non_rewrite_report
                 expr.sexp_loc
                 Warning
                 "found a usage of the constant 42"
           | _ -> []
         in
         stateless_style_checker ~on_expression ()

       This creates a style checker that produces a warning every time the
       integer literal 42 is encountered in the student's code.

       See the ast_style_check_structure function for information on
       running these style checkers.

       The functions rewrite_report_expr and rewrite_report_vb, listed

       preferred over the lower-level rewrite_report function.
